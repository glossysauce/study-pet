# Study Pet: Embedded Study Companion)

This is a tamagotchi style embedded productivity companion that tracks your focus via app usage in real time and visualizes pet health on an LCD display. When you stay focused, the pet's health recovers, and its mood will increase. When you get distracted, the pet's health declines, triggering worse mood overtime and triggers a buzzer. The point is to make distraction visible instead of invisible, and staying focused a more engaging activity.

## Why I built this
I notice that I easily get distracted while studying without noticing. I wanted a system that logs distraction episodes and time spent off-task, then reflects that behavior back to me through a simple virtual pet. The goal is awareness and behavior feedback as motivation, not perfect productivity.
